<p> The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. </p>
<p> The properties:</p>
<ol style="1">
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>SMALLEST</u> </font>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. </li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>INSIDER</u> </font>It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU. </li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS</u> </font>One day on Mercury (the time it takes for Mercury to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days. </li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>ROUGH SURFACE</u> </font> Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>CAN'T BREATHE IT</u> </font>Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). Atoms that are blasted off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts create Mercury's exosphere. </li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>MOONLESS</u> </font> Mercury has no moons. </li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>RINGLESS</u> </font> There are no rings around Mercury. </li>
