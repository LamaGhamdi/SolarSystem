<section class="section-light">
<p>The Sun the heart of our solar system is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.
The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and aurorae. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<h4>The properties:</h4>

<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>BIGGEST</u></font> If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel. </li>
<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>MOST MASSIVE</u></font>The Sun is the center of our solar system and makes up 99.8 percent of the mass of the entire solar system.</li>
<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>DIFFERENT SPINS</u></font>At the equator, the Sun spins once about every 25 days, but at its poles the Sun rotates once on its axis every 35 Earth days.</li>
<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>CAN not STAND ON IT</u></font>As a star, the Sun is a ball of gas (92.1 percent hydrogen and 7.8 percent helium) held together by its own gravity.</li>
<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>RINGLESS</u></font>The Sun does not have any rings.</li>
<li><font color="#5098C8"><u>UNDER STUDY</u></font>Many spacecraft constantly observe the Sun, helping us keep an eye on space weather that can affect satellites and astronauts. </li>
<li> <font color="#5098C8"><u>ENERGY FOR LIFE</u></font>Without the Sun's intense energy, there would be no life on Earth.</li>
